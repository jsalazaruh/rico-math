### Ricomath

Ricomath is a math game focused on enhancing speed of arithmetics. It was completed with the use of HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. There are four different operations for which the user can enhance their arithmatic skills. Soon after selecting the operation, the user will be directed to the configurations page. The ability to enter the amount of questions the operator wishes to answer are one of the options; as well as, the amount of time being given & the range of digits of the questions. The timer will start one second after the click of the thumbs up button. This was implemented with the user in mind to give the user a small amount of time to get prepared for the questions. As the questions are being answered, the user will see a red line on top of the questions page. This will provide the remainder of time that they have in order to finish the quantity of questions have given. When the timer runs out of time, it will automatically redirect the current page to the finishing page displaying the percentage of how many questions the user got correct. Below this information, the user will have the option to restart the session with the same configuration. The home button will direct them to the beginning of the settings options.
